Hi, I'm Barnaby Keene, also known as Southclaws.

Experienced with a wide variety of creative tools and technical skills, I like to solve design, storytelling and technical problems in digital media.

Q: Why are most of your repos archived?
A: I've partly moved away from software to focus on other things. I don't wish to maintain many of these projects any more. Most of them are in a completed state and do not need any updates. Some may have bugs that need to be fixed, if this is the case, fork and fix! New maintainers welcome.
